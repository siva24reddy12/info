In the era of information abundance, managing, classifying, and retrieving textual data effectively are crucial for knowledge extraction and informed decision-making. With the exponential growth of text data, sophisticated systems capable of not only storing vast datasets but also facilitating meaningful interactions with the information within them are increasingly necessary. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated framework that synergistically combines information storage, text classification, and advanced information retrieval (IR) techniques, including TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BM25 (Best Match 25) algorithms [1].
Traditional IR systems often rely on simple keyword matching, which can fail to capture the nuanced relationships and contextual meaning embedded in text. To overcome these limitations, our proposed framework incorporates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including:
•	Text classification: Utilizing Word2Vec embeddings to categorize documents into relevant classes, enhancing information organization and enabling more targeted IR.
•	BERT-based semantic similarity models: Moving beyond keyword matching by considering the contextual intricacies of language to improve the retrieval of relevant documents [2].
By incorporating TF-IDF and BM25, our framework weights the importance of terms within documents and across the overall corpus, further enhancing the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval. This integrated approach addresses the evolving needs of information seekers and paves the way for more efficient and effective knowledge extraction.
The research presented in this paper is validated through experiments on a subset of the CORD-19 dataset, a widely studied collection of COVID-19 literature. The results demonstrate significant improvements in document organization, classification accuracy, and information retrieval precision. Additionally, we explore the impact of key parameters on the system's performance, providing valuable insights for further development and optimization.
Our work contributes to the advancement of information management systems by proposing a unified and versatile framework. This framework not only addresses the challenges posed by vast amounts of textual data but also offers a robust solution applicable across diverse domains. We believe that the findings presented in this paper will empower researchers, practitioners, and information professionals to navigate and extract valuable insights from expansive textual repositories, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge discovery and informed decision-making.
